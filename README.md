# Test
(header lines need to have blank lines above and below)

This is me trying to figure out how to play with the fonts.  
Like for example if I feel like I'm cool enough to have my name in bold,  
I'll just pray to the R god and boom **Daniel**.  
Say, maybe I can make my name look classier, say *Daniel*  
Can you imagine if there were 2 Daniels? It'd be Daniel^2^ ... so annoying  
Here'smy favorite artist by the way!  
Gustavo Cerati: ![](/Users/Daniel/Desktop/gustavo_cerati.jpg)
