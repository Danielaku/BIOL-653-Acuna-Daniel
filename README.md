Anyway,... because I worked with 3 computers everything was all messed up but because you helped me everything seems nice now.
So, after creating my files i check my git status and noticed that I had a couple of files in 1 of the 3 folders I have in my R_projects file in my desktop.
Because I already created the files you asjed me for,  I directly jumped into "git init" to initiate the git repository
I checked my git status and then use the "git add" to add all the crap I need to add...
I checked the status and then used "git commit" 
After that, I went to github and copy/paste the link where I'll send all the file to. In this case it was the folder ending in hw (homework) and added .git to the whole url:

https://github.com/Danielaku/BIOL-653-Acuna-Daniel_hw.git

Note to self: When doing the previous step, forgot to add the .git add the end and therefore I had to remove the remote using this -> https://help.github.com/articles/removing-a-remote/

I checked my git remote... git remote -v

Now it seems like I'm ready to finally push ^-^
